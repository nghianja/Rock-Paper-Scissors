# Project: Rock-Paper-Scissors
### About
If you’ve ever wanted to create games, this project will get you started! In this project you will code a Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock game, a more advanced version of Rock-Paper-Scissors, which can be played against the computer.
### Learning outcomes
A playable Rock-Paper-Scissors game, with a Player vs Computer mode. Practice using arrays, the Random library, formatted strings, and algorithms.
### This project is a part of the following learning goals
Python Developer
## What you’ll do and what you’ll learn
### Stage 1/5: Unfair computer
Before learning how to play the game properly, let’s learn how to cheat! Using conditional statements, you’ll write a program that always defeats the human player in the Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
### Stage 2/5: Equalizing chances
Let’s not mess with the player too much, though: from now on, we’re going to play fair. You’ll be able to do this with the help of the random module, while string formatting will assist you in announcing the end result of the game.
### Stage 3/5: Endless game
Can’t stop, won’t stop! A single game is never enough. Learn about loops in Python and apply them to make multiple game rounds possible.
### Stage 4/5: The game score
It’s time to find out who the best Rock-Paper-Scissors player is! You are going to need the basics of file handling to read the records of the results of previous games, as well as tally the user’s score in the current game.
### Stage 5/5: More options
Let's raise the stakes, shall we? In the final stage of the project, your program will let the player choose what options will be used in the game and how many of them will be there. This will require some more advanced knowledge about lists in Python.
